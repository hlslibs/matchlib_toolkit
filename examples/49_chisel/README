This simple example demonstrates how to create dynamic structure in SystemC and Catapult
similar to Chisel.


Steps:

1. View "dut.h" and note similarities/differences to a Verilog module.
   view dut.h

2. View testbench.h to see instantiation and stimulus of DUT.
   view testbench.h

3. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

4. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

5. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

6. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

7. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

8. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

9. View generated RTL and compare to SC model before HLS synthesis
   view Catapult/dut.v1/rtl.v

10. Delete all generated files
    make clean
