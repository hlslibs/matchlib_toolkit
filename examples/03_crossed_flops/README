This simple example demonstrates two crossed "flops" that are modeled in SystemC and synthesized to RLT via Catapult HLS.
The purpose of this example is show how SystemC very accurately models sequential processes, both in
the SystemC simulation and in the HLS-generated RTL.


Steps:

1. View "flop.h" and note similarities/differences to a Verilog module.
   view flop.h

2. View testbench.h to see instantiation and stimulus of DUT.
   view testbench.h

3. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

4. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

5. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

6. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

7. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

8. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

9. View generated RTL and compare to SC model before HLS synthesis
   view Catapult/flop.v1/rtl.v

10. Delete all generated files
    make clean
