Very simple Matchlib model showing Pre-HLS and Post-HLS simulations

This example shows how Matchlib enables a model (and testbench) to be "throughput accurate"
even when the DUT has multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Note that the thruput is 1 clock cycle.

The "p2p*" directories show the same design modeled using the "p2p" library. Note that the P2P
library makes it difficult/impossible to achieve a thruput of 1 clock cycle for this design and its
testbench.


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

7. Delete all generated files
    make clean
