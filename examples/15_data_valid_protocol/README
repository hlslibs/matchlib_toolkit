This example illustrates the recommended way to model data/valid protocols
(which are different than ready/data/valid protocols normally used in Matchlib)

Note that data/valid is a time-sensitive protocol (unlike ready/data/valid).
This example shows that some packets are dropped in the RTL simulation because
the RTL DUT has longer latency than the SC DUT. This is to be expected with this protocol.


Steps:

3. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make

4. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

5. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   ./vsim_vcd

6. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

7. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

8. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

9. Delete all generated files
    make clean
