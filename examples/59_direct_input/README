Catapult SystemC Direct Inputs Testcase with Loop II=4

Note: pre-generated log files from TB are in run_logs.
These enable easy comparison of scenarios below just by using "diff".

A. Pre-HLS Steps:

1. Build and run the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   (Output responses will be logged to pre_hls.log)

   make run

   View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave


B. Post-HLS Using Regular SystemC signals (ie no direct inputs)
   (Output responses will be logged to regular_signals.log)

   BATCH: make regular_signals

   INTERACTIVE: catapult -f regular_signals.tcl &
                dofile scverify.tcl


C. Post-HLS Using Direct Inputs and DIRECT_INPUT_SYNC
   (Output responses will be logged to direct_input_sync.log)

   BATCH: make direct_input_sync

   INTERACTIVE: catapult -f direct_input_sync.tcl &
                dofile scverify.tcl


D. Post-HLS Using Direct Inputs and NO DIRECT_INPUT_SYNC
   (Output responses will be logged to direct_input_no_sync.log)

   BATCH: make direct_input_no_sync

   INTERACTIVE: catapult -f direct_input_no_sync.tcl &
                dofile scverify.tcl
